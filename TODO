What is NeoQL
===============

NeoQL job is to provide a database as close to the GUI as possible. In any  big Application, the program is divided into layers, one of them is for data persistence.
There are many  available technologies to help developpers handling persistence: mainly database technologies ( SQL, ORM, JPA, etc.).
On the contrary, the GUI layer is very empty. Here comes NeoQL mission.

NeoQL tend to act like a database, but as close to the GUI as possible. This as consequences:

  - we cannot be the persistence database => NeoQL database is not persistent.
  - using a database in a GUI require that the database be as much observable as possible.
  - because we do assume that NeoQL is the topmost layer, NeoQL must be easy to use with underlying layer (mainly service layer, or database layer).
